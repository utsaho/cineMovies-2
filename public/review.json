My emotions throughout the film was like a roller coaster, going from sad to jubilant in a matter of seconds. I mainly recommend this film to anyone who is unsure of watching a Bollywood film, yet I also recommend this film to every other person in the entirety of the earth."

        "review": "The first half is a sweet romance story filled with laughs and warmth about a charming, gentle, yet humorous Italian-Jewish waiter who eventually wins the heart of the girl of his dreams. The second half is a heartfelt story of a father protecting his young son's innocence in spite of everything horrible going on within the setting of a concentration camp."

Joss had a lot of things in his hands while making this movie and that's it's characters, story, action and it's brilliant sense of humor, and it payed off well. Joss Whedon did a great job directing this movie as he put in enough energy and to entertain everyone."
